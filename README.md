##Features

###Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

 Every feature on the website is designed to be responsive with any device. The Navigation Bar is is designed to collapse to allow the user to see the rest of the website easier.

##### Page Titles

The page title is a simple hyperlink back to the home page to give the user's a fast and easy way to go back. The other page titles are also hyperlinks to enter each individual page.

##### Nav Bar Collapsed Menu Button

 The Menu button seen when the website is on a smaller resolution, is used as a dropdown menu. This helps to reduce cluttering of the website.

#### Home Screen Images/Text

 The home page has a small briefing of each page of the website. In this brief it explains what you will encounter when arrive on them. All of the images/text areas
are hyperlinks to the pages described.

#### Workout/Meal Plan/Recipe pages

 On the following pages will be a blank box where a user can enter a username and type out either one of their workout routines, meal plans or recipes. Once the user has
entered a post it will be there to see for others users to look through. There is also a remove and edit button. Allowing users to change something or delete if they change there mind.

### Future Features

Other features that could be implemented in the future could be sign in method allowing users to enter into there own profile page showing every one of there past posts. Allowing
them to choose if they'd like to remove something from an earlier date. Furthermore, a like button or a comment area could be added to give the other users reading a chance to
share there opinion on someone elses post.
